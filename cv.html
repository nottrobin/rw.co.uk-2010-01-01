        <h1>Work at Tamar.com Ltd.<small> - Web developer - August '05 to present</small></h1>
        <h2>A leading website design and search engine optimisation agency.</h2>
      </header>
      <p>I have been working for Tamar as a web developer on and off for over 4 years, contributing to her growth from under 30 employees to over 60 employees on 3 continents in a development team which expanded from just 3 to over 10 people.</p>
      <p>I collaborated with other perl and .net developers as well as with the design team on both small and large projects, producing and improving programming solutions for online insurance and loan quote engines (e.g. endsleigh.co.uk) and ecommerce sites (e.g. dreams.co.uk) for dozens of clients. I integrated and maintained server- and client-side solutions, usually scheduling multiple tasks simultaneously and responding to tight deadlines.</p>
      <p>Having a lead role in the client-side development project for the re-design of bennetts.co.uk, I was solely responsible for designing the templating structure and CSS code, as well as coordinating development.</p>
      <p>I completely wrote the JavaScript for a new student insurance quote engine for Endsleigh (endsleigh.co.uk/student-possessions.html). As this was the largest and most complex JavaScript project, and the only one involving Ajax technology, that Tamar has ever undertaken, I created a whole JavaScript library base for Tamar to work with in future. Two years later I was rewrote the whole system to integrate with the jQuery JavaScript library.</p>
      <p>I worked as the project manager for Tamar’s experience design team for two weeks in 2006 and again for a week in 2007. I responded to clients’ calls and emails and scheduled and balanced tasks throughout the team under time pressure.</p>
      <p>Since December 2007 I have been working part-time and remotely, balancing work for Tamar with my MSc.  I had to manage my time well and flexibly negotiate my needs with Tamar's.</p>
