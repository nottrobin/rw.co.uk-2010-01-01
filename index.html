<h1>Homepage currently under construction</h1>
<p>Hi. My name's Robin Winslow, and this will be my home page.</p>
<p>It will contain information about me and my interests - and my blog - 
as well as information on my academic and professional credentials, 
examples of my web development work and little programs and scripts I've 
experimented with.</p><p>
</p><p>Although this site is still in its planning stage and probably won't 
be done before the beginning of 2009 - please do check back then if 
you're interested :).</p>
<h2>Progress updates</h2>
<p><strong>From the 12th of September in the year of 2008</strong></p>
<p>Not much has happened to help the website. Still. But I have switched host. I am now hosted by <a href="http://tsohost.co.uk/">TSO host</a>.
And I'm well impressed. They are not only good value for money (the
best in the UK), they also have fantastic customer support, their
servers run impressively fast, and everything is done in the simplest
most intuitive way.</p>
<p>I think I'm in love.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you know are thinking of switching host I would seriously recommend checking out these guys.</p>
<p><strong>From the 7th of August in the year of 2008</strong></p>
<p>I've nothing further to report, I'm only posting here so I don't forget about it ;).</p>
<p><strong>From the 4th or August in the year of 2008</strong></p>
<p>In Cefalonia, in Greece, and it's hot. And finding internet is a challenge, and I haven't got any further with the website :(.</p>
<p>I've decided to work on my CV first, and get that up here, and then I'll work on the website design.</p>
<p><strong>From the 18th of July in the year of 2008</strong></p>
<p>I'm just about to leave on holiday for three and a half weeks, but I'm taking a lot of reading with me, as well as my laptop.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the time I get back I will have got a lot further with the planning.</p>
